The project model is applicable to the design of basic three-servo robotic fish, as shown in the example in the figure below. (this example is developed at the Theoretical Ecology and Evolution Laboratory, [Indian Institute of Science] (https://www.iisc.ac.in "Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru").)
